DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     ttmmuuxx is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be
     created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen.  ttmmuuxx may be
     detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later
     reattached.

     When ttmmuuxx is started it creates a new _s_e_s_s_i_o_n with a single _w_i_n_d_o_w and
     displays it on screen.  A status line at the bottom of the screen shows
     information on the current session and is used to enter interactive com-
     mands.

     A session is a single collection of _p_s_e_u_d_o _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l_s under the management
     of ttmmuuxx.  Each session has one or more windows linked to it.  A window
     occupies the entire screen and may be split into rectangular panes, each
     of which is a separate pseudo terminal (the pty(4) manual page documents
     the technical details of pseudo terminals).  Any number of ttmmuuxx instances
     may connect to the same session, and any number of windows may be present
     in the same session.  Once all sessions are killed, ttmmuuxx exits.

     Each session is persistent and will survive accidental disconnection
     (such as ssh(1) connection timeout) or intentional detaching (with the
     ‘C-b d’ key strokes).  ttmmuuxx may be reattached using:

           $ tmux attach

     In ttmmuuxx, a session is displayed on screen by a _c_l_i_e_n_t and all sessions
     are managed by a single _s_e_r_v_e_r.  The server and each client are separate
     processes which communicate through a socket in _/_t_m_p.

     The options are as follows:

     --22            Force ttmmuuxx to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.

     --88            Like --22, but indicates that the terminal supports 88
                   colours.

     --cc _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
                   Execute _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d using the default shell.  If neces-
                   sary, the ttmmuuxx server will be started to retrieve the
                   ddeeffaauulltt--sshheellll option.

     --ff _f_i_l_e       Specify an alternative configuration file.  By default,
                   ttmmuuxx loads the system configuration file from
                   _/_e_t_c_/_t_m_u_x_._c_o_n_f, if present, then looks for a user configu-
                   ration file at _~_/_._t_m_u_x_._c_o_n_f.  The configuration file is a
                   set of ttmmuuxx commands which are executed in sequence when
                   the server is first started.

                   If a command in the configuration file fails, ttmmuuxx will
                   report an error and exit without executing further com-
                   mands.

     --ll            Behave as a login shell.  This flag currently has no effect
                   and is for compatibility with other shells when using tmux
                   as a login shell.

     --LL _s_o_c_k_e_t_-_n_a_m_e
                   ttmmuuxx stores the server socket in a directory under _/_t_m_p;
                   the default socket is named _d_e_f_a_u_l_t.  This option allows a
                   different socket name to be specified, allowing several
                   independent ttmmuuxx servers to be run.  Unlike --SS a full path
                   is not necessary: the sockets are all created in the same
                   directory.

                   If the socket is accidentally removed, the SIGUSR1 signal
                   may be sent to the ttmmuuxx server process to recreate it.

     --qq            Prevent the server sending various informational messages,
                   for example when window flags are altered.

     --SS _s_o_c_k_e_t_-_p_a_t_h
                   Specify a full alternative path to the server socket.  If
                   --SS is specified, the default socket directory is not used
                   and any --LL flag is ignored.

     --uu            ttmmuuxx attempts to guess if the terminal is likely to support
                   UTF-8 by checking the first of the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and
                   LANG environment variables to be set for the string
                   "UTF-8".  This is not always correct: the --uu flag explic-
                   itly informs ttmmuuxx that UTF-8 is supported.

                   If the server is started from a client passed --uu or where
                   UTF-8 is detected, the uuttff88 and ssttaattuuss--uuttff88 options are
                   enabled in the global window and session options respec-
                   tively.

     --vv            Request verbose logging.  This option may be specified mul-
                   tiple times for increasing verbosity.  Log messages will be
                   saved into _t_m_u_x_-_c_l_i_e_n_t_-_P_I_D_._l_o_g and _t_m_u_x_-_s_e_r_v_e_r_-_P_I_D_._l_o_g
                   files in the current directory, where _P_I_D is the PID of the
                   server or client process.

     _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_f_l_a_g_s]
                   This specifies one of a set of commands used to control
                   ttmmuuxx, as described in the following sections.  If no com-
                   mands are specified, the nneeww--sseessssiioonn command is assumed.

KKEEYY BBIINNDDIINNGGSS
     ttmmuuxx may be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination
     of a prefix key, ‘C-b’ (Ctrl-b) by default, followed by a command key.

     Some of the default key bindings are:

           c       Create a new window.
           d       Detach the current client.
           l       Move to the previously selected window.
           n       Change to the next window.
           p       Change to the previous window.
           &       Kill the current window.
           ,       Rename the current window.
           ?       List all key bindings.

     A complete list may be obtained with the lliisstt--kkeeyyss command (bound to ‘?’
     by default).  Key bindings may be changed with the bbiinndd--kkeeyy and
     uunnbbiinndd--kkeeyy commands.

CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
     This section contains a list of the commands supported by ttmmuuxx.  Most
     commands accept the optional --tt argument with one of _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t,
     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w, or _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e.  These specify the client,
     session, window or pane which a command should affect.  _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t is
     the name of the pty(4) file to which the client is connected, for example
     either of _/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y_p_1 or _t_t_y_p_1 for the client attached to _/_d_e_v_/_t_t_y_p_1.  If
     no client is specified, the current client is chosen, if possible, or an
     error is reported.  Clients may be listed with the lliisstt--cclliieennttss command.

     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n is either the name of a session (as listed by the
     lliisstt--sseessssiioonnss command) or the name of a client with the same syntax as
     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t, in which case the session attached to the client is used.
     When looking for the session name, ttmmuuxx initially searches for an exact
     match; if none is found, the session names are checked for any for which
     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n is a prefix or for which it matches as an fnmatch(3) pat-
     tern.  If a single match is found, it is used as the target session; mul-
     tiple matches produce an error.  If a session is omitted, the current
     session is used if available; if no current session is available, the
     most recently used is chosen.

     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w specifies a window in the form _s_e_s_s_i_o_n:_w_i_n_d_o_w.  _s_e_s_s_i_o_n
     follows the same rules as for _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n, and _w_i_n_d_o_w is looked for in
     order: as a window index, for example mysession:1; as an exact window
     name, such as mysession:mywindow; then as an fnmatch(3) pattern or the
     start of a window name, such as mysession:mywin* or mysession:mywin.  An
     empty window name specifies the next unused index if appropriate (for
     example the nneeww--wwiinnddooww and lliinnkk--wwiinnddooww commands) otherwise the current
     window in _s_e_s_s_i_o_n is chosen.  When the argument does not contain a colon,
     ttmmuuxx first attempts to parse it as window; if that fails, an attempt is
     made to match a session.

     _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e takes a similar form to _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w but with the optional
     addition of a period followed by a pane index, for example: myses-
     sion:mywindow.1.  If the pane index is omitted, the currently active pane
     in the specified window is used.  If neither a colon nor period appears,
     ttmmuuxx first attempts to use the argument as a pane index; if that fails,
     it is looked up as for _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w.

     Multiple commands may be specified together as part of a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
     _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e.  Each command should be separated by spaces and a semicolon;
     commands are executed sequentially from left to right.  A literal semi-
     colon may be included by escaping it with a backslash (for example, when
     specifying a command sequence to bbiinndd--kkeeyy).

     Examples include:

           refresh-client -t/dev/ttyp2

           rename-session -tfirst newname

           set-window-option -t:0 monitor-activity on

           new-window ; split-window -d

CCLLIIEENNTTSS AANNDD SSEESSSSIIOONNSS
     The following commands are available:

     aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn [--dd] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n]
                   (alias: aattttaacchh)
             If run from outside ttmmuuxx, create a new client in the current ter-
             minal and attach it to _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n.  If used from inside,
             switch the current client.  If --dd is specified, any other clients
             attached to the session are detached.

             If no server is started, aattttaacchh--sseessssiioonn will attempt to start it;
             this will fail unless sessions are created in the configuration
             file.

     ddeettaacchh--cclliieenntt [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t]
                   (alias: ddeettaacchh)
             Detach the current client if bound to a key, or the specified
             client with --tt.

     hhaass--sseessssiioonn [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n]
                   (alias: hhaass)
             Report an error and exit with 1 if the specified session does not
             exist.  If it does exist, exit with 0.

     kkiillll--sseerrvveerr
             Kill the ttmmuuxx server and clients and destroy all sessions.

     kkiillll--sseessssiioonn [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n]
             Destroy the given session, closing any windows linked to it and
             no other sessions, and detaching all clients attached to it.

     lliisstt--cclliieennttss
                   (alias: llsscc)

             [_c_o_m_m_a_n_d]
                   (alias: nneeww)
             Create a new session with name _s_e_s_s_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e.  The new session is
             attached to the current terminal unless --dd is given.  _w_i_n_d_o_w_-_n_a_m_e
             and _c_o_m_m_a_n_d are the name of and command to execute in the initial
             window.

             If run from a terminal, any termios(4) special characters are
             saved and used for new windows in the new session.

             If --tt is given, the new session is _g_r_o_u_p_e_d with _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n.
             This means they share the same set of windows - all windows from
             _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n are linked to the new session and any subsequent
             new windows or windows being closed are applied to both sessions.
             The current and previous window and any session options remain
             independent and either session may be killed without affecting
             the other.  Giving --nn or _c_o_m_m_a_n_d are invalid if --tt is used.

                   (alias: rreeffrreesshh)
             Refresh the current client if bound to a key, or a single client
             if one is given with --tt.

                   (alias: rreennaammee)
             Rename the session to _n_e_w_-_n_a_m_e.

WWIINNDDOOWWSS AANNDD PPAANNEESS
     A ttmmuuxx window may be in one of several modes.  The default permits direct
     access to the terminal attached to the window.  The others are:

     _o_u_t_p_u_t _m_o_d_e
             This is entered when a command which produces output, such as
             lliisstt--kkeeyyss, is executed from a key binding.

     _c_o_p_y _m_o_d_e
             This permits a section of a window or its history to be copied to
             a _p_a_s_t_e _b_u_f_f_e_r for later insertion into another window.  This
             mode is entered with the ccooppyy--mmooddee command, bound to ‘[’ by
             default.

     The keys available depend on whether emacs or vi mode is selected (see
     the mmooddee--kkeeyyss option).  The following keys are supported as appropriate
     for the mode:

     These key bindings are defined in a set of named tables: _v_i_-_e_d_i_t and
     _e_m_a_c_s_-_e_d_i_t for keys used when line editing at the command prompt;
     _v_i_-_c_h_o_i_c_e and _e_m_a_c_s_-_c_h_o_i_c_e for keys used when choosing from lists (such
     as produced by the wwiinnddooww--cchhoooossee command) or in output mode; and _v_i_-_c_o_p_y
     and _e_m_a_c_s_-_c_o_p_y used in copy mode.  The tables may be viewed with the
     lliisstt--kkeeyyss command and keys modified or removed with bbiinndd--kkeeyy and
     uunnbbiinndd--kkeeyy.

     The paste buffer key pastes the first line from the top paste buffer on
     the stack.

     The mode commands are as follows:

     ccooppyy--mmooddee [--uu] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e]
             Enter copy mode.  The --uu option scrolls one page up.

     Each window displayed by ttmmuuxx may be split into one or more _p_a_n_e_s; each
     pane takes up a certain area of the display and is a separate terminal.
     A window may be split into panes using the sspplliitt--wwiinnddooww command.  Windows
     may be split horizontally (with the --hh flag) or vertically.  Panes may be
     resized with the rreessiizzee--ppaannee command (bound to ‘C-up’, ‘C-down’ ‘C-left’
     and ‘C-right’ by default), the current pane may be changed with the
     uupp--ppaannee and ddoowwnn--ppaannee commands and the rroottaattee--wwiinnddooww and sswwaapp--ppaannee com-
     mands may be used to swap panes without changing their position.  Panes
     are numbered beginning from zero in the order they are created.

     A number of preset _l_a_y_o_u_t_s are available.  These may be selected with the
     sseelleecctt--llaayyoouutt command or cycled with nneexxtt--llaayyoouutt (bound to ‘C-space’ by
     default); once a layout is chosen, panes within it may be moved and
     resized as normal.

     The following layouts are supported:

     eevveenn--hhoorriizzoonnttaall
             Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the window.

     eevveenn--vveerrttiiccaall
             Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.

     mmaaiinn--hhoorriizzoonnttaall
             A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the
             remaining panes are spread from left to right in the leftover
             space at the bottom.  Use the _m_a_i_n_-_p_a_n_e_-_h_e_i_g_h_t window option to
             specify the height of the top pane.

     mmaaiinn--vveerrttiiccaall
             Similar to mmaaiinn--hhoorriizzoonnttaall but the large pane is placed on the
             left and the others spread from top to bottom along the right.
             See the _m_a_i_n_-_p_a_n_e_-_w_i_d_t_h window option.

     Commands related to windows and panes are as follows:

     bbrreeaakk--ppaannee [--dd] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e]
                   (alias: bbrreeaakkpp)
             Break _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e off from its containing window to make it the
             only pane in a new window.  If --dd is given, the new window does
             not become the current window.

     cchhoooossee--cclliieenntt [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w] [_t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e]
             Put a window into client choice mode, allowing a client to be
             selected interactively from a list.  After a client is chosen,
             ‘%%’ is replaced by the client pty(4) path in _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e and the
             result executed as a command.  If _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e is not given, "detach-
             client -t ’%%’" is used.  This command works only from inside
             ttmmuuxx.

     cchhoooossee--sseessssiioonn [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w] [_t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e]
             Put a window into session choice mode, where a session may be
             selected interactively from a list.  When one is chosen, ‘%%’ is
             replaced by the session name in _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e and the result executed
             as a command.  If _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e is not given, "switch-client -t ’%%’"
             is used.  This command works only from inside ttmmuuxx.

             Put a window into window choice mode, where a window may be cho-
             sen interactively from a list.  After a window is selected, ‘%%’
             is replaced by the session name and window index in _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e and
             the result executed as a command.  If _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e is not given,
             "select-window -t ’%%’" is used.  This command works only from
             inside ttmmuuxx.

             Display a visible indicator of each pane shown by _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t.
             See the ddiissppllaayy--ppaanneess--ttiimmee and ddiissppllaayy--ppaanneess--ccoolloouurr session
             options.  While the indicator is on screen, a pane may be
             selected with the ‘0’ to ‘9’ keys.

                   (alias: ffiinnddww)
             Search for the fnmatch(3) pattern _m_a_t_c_h_-_s_t_r_i_n_g in window names,
             titles, and visible content (but not history).  If only one win-
             dow is matched, it’ll be automatically selected, otherwise a
             choice list is shown.  This command only works from inside ttmmuuxx.

     kkiillll--ppaannee [--aa] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e]
                   (alias: kkiillllpp)
             Destroy the given pane.  If no panes remain in the containing
             window, it is also destroyed.  The --aa option kills all but the
             pane given with --tt.

                   (alias: kkiillllww)
             Kill the current window or the window at _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w, removing
             it from any sessions to which it is linked.

                   (alias: llaasstt)
             Select the last (previously selected) window.  If no
             _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n is specified, select the last window of the cur-

                   (alias: lliinnkkww)
             Link the window at _s_r_c_-_w_i_n_d_o_w to the specified _d_s_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w.  If
             _d_s_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w is specified and no such window exists, the _s_r_c_-_w_i_n_d_o_w
             is linked there.  If --kk is given and _d_s_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w exists, it is
             killed, otherwise an error is generated.  If --dd is given, the
             newly linked window is not selected.

     lliisstt--ppaanneess [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w]

             List the panes in the current window or in _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w.

     lliisstt--wwiinnddoowwss [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n]

                   (alias: mmoovveeww)
             This is similar to lliinnkk--wwiinnddooww, except the window at _s_r_c_-_w_i_n_d_o_w
             is moved to _d_s_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w.

                   (alias: nneewwww)
             Create a new window.  If --dd is given, the session does not make
             the new window the current window.  _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w represents the
             window to be created; if the target already exists an error is
             shown, unless the --kk flag is used, in which case it is destroyed.
             _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is the command to execute.  If _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is not specified,
             the default command is used.

             The TERM environment variable must be set to “screen” for all
             programs running _i_n_s_i_d_e ttmmuuxx.  New windows will automatically
             have “TERM=screen” added to their environment, but care must be
             taken not to reset this in shell start-up files.

     nneexxtt--llaayyoouutt [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w]

             Pipe any output sent by the program in _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_p_a_n_e to a shell
             command.  A pane may only be piped to one command at a time, any

             The --oo option only opens a new pipe if no previous pipe exists,
             allowing a pipe to be toggled with a single key, for example:

KKEEYY BBIINNDDIINNGGSS
     ttmmuuxx allows a command to be bound to most keys, with or without a prefix
     key.  When specifying keys, most represent themselves (for example ‘A’ to
     ‘Z’).  Ctrl keys may be prefixed with ‘C-’ or ‘^’, and Alt (meta) with
     ‘M-’.  In addition, the following special key names are accepted: _B_S_p_a_c_e,
     _B_T_a_b, _D_C (Delete), _E_n_d, _E_n_t_e_r, _E_s_c_a_p_e, _F_1 to _F_2_0, _H_o_m_e, _I_C (Insert),
     _N_P_a_g_e (Page Up), _P_P_a_g_e (Page Down), _S_p_a_c_e, and _T_a_b.  Note that to bind
     the ‘"’ or ‘’’ keys, quotation marks are necessary, for example:

           bind-key ’"’ split-window
           bind-key "’" select-prompt

     Commands related to key bindings are as follows:

     bbiinndd--kkeeyy [--ccnnrr] [--tt _k_e_y_-_t_a_b_l_e] _k_e_y _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s]

             Bind key _k_e_y to _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  By default (without --tt) the primary key
             bindings are modified (those normally activated with the prefix
             key); in this case, if --nn is specified, it is not necessary to
             use the prefix key, _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is bound to _k_e_y alone.  The --rr flag
             indicates this key may repeat, see the rreeppeeaatt--ttiimmee option.

             If --tt is present, _k_e_y is bound in _k_e_y_-_t_a_b_l_e: the binding for com-
             mand mode with --cc or for normal mode without.  To view the
             default bindings and possible commands, see the lliisstt--kkeeyyss com-
             mand.

             List all key bindings.  Without --tt the primary key bindings -
             those executed when preceded by the prefix key - are printed.
             Keys bound without the prefix key (see bbiinndd--kkeeyy --nn) are enclosed
             in square brackets.

             With --tt, the key bindings in _k_e_y_-_t_a_b_l_e are listed; this may be
             one of: _v_i_-_e_d_i_t, _e_m_a_c_s_-_e_d_i_t, _v_i_-_c_h_o_i_c_e, _e_m_a_c_s_-_c_h_o_i_c_e, _v_i_-_c_o_p_y or

             Send a key or keys to a window.  Each argument _k_e_y is the name of
             the key (such as ‘C-a’ or ‘npage’ ) to send; if the string is not
             recognised as a key, it is sent as a series of characters.  All

             Unbind the command bound to _k_e_y.  Without --tt the primary key
             bindings are modified; in this case, if --nn is specified, the com-
             mand bound to _k_e_y without a prefix (if any) is removed.

             If --tt is present, _k_e_y in _k_e_y_-_t_a_b_l_e is unbound: the binding for
             command mode with --cc or for normal mode without.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     The appearance and behaviour of ttmmuuxx may be modified by changing the
     value of various options.  There are two types of option: _s_e_s_s_i_o_n _o_p_t_i_o_n_s
     and _w_i_n_d_o_w _o_p_t_i_o_n_s.

     Each individual session may have a set of session options, and there is a
     separate set of global session options.  Sessions which do not have a
     particular option configured inherit the value from the global session
     options.  Session options are set or unset with the sseett--ooppttiioonn command
     and may be listed with the sshhooww--ooppttiioonnss command.  The available session
     options are listed under the sseett--ooppttiioonn command.

     Similarly, a set of window options is attached to each window, and there
     is a set of global window options from which any unset options are inher-
     ited.  Window options are altered with the sseett--wwiinnddooww--ooppttiioonn command and
     can be listed with the sshhooww--wwiinnddooww--ooppttiioonnss command.  All window options
     are documented with the sseett--wwiinnddooww--ooppttiioonn command.

     Commands which set options are as follows:

     sseett--ooppttiioonn [--aagguu] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n] _o_p_t_i_o_n _v_a_l_u_e
                   (alias: sseett)
             Set a session option.  With --aa, and if the option expects a
             string, _v_a_l_u_e is appended to the existing setting.  If --gg is
             specified, the global session option is set.  The --uu flag unsets
             an option, so a session inherits the option from the global
             options - it is not possible to unset a global option.

             Available session options are:

             bbaassee--iinnddeexx _i_n_d_e_x
                     Set the base index from which an unused index should be
                     searched when a new window is created.  The default is

                     Set action on window bell.  aannyy means a bell in any win-
                     dow linked to a session causes a bell in the current win-
                     dow of that session, nnoonnee means all bells are ignored and
                     ccuurrrreenntt means only bell in windows other than the current
                     window are ignored.

             bbuuffffeerr--lliimmiitt _n_u_m_b_e_r
                     Set the number of buffers kept for each session; as new
                     buffers are added to the top of the stack, old ones are
                     removed from the bottom if necessary to maintain this
                     maximum length.

                     Set the command used for new windows (if not specified
                     when the window is created) to _c_o_m_m_a_n_d, which may be any
                     sh(1) command.  The default is an empty string, which
                     instructs ttmmuuxx to create a login shell using the value of
                     the ddeeffaauulltt--sshheellll option.

             ddeeffaauulltt--sshheellll _p_a_t_h
                     Specify the default shell.  This is used as the login
                     shell for new windows when the ddeeffaauulltt--ccoommmmaanndd option is
                     set to empty, and must be the full path of the exe-
                     cutable.  When started ttmmuuxx tries to set a default value
                     from the first suitable of the SHELL environment vari-
                     able, the shell returned by getpwuid(3), or _/_b_i_n_/_s_h.
                     This option should be configured when ttmmuuxx is used as a
                     login shell.

             ddeeffaauulltt--ppaatthh _p_a_t_h
                     Set the default working directory for processes created
                     from keys, or interactively from the prompt.  The default

                     default, the session name is shown.  _s_t_r_i_n_g may contain
                     any of the following special character sequences:

                           #H                Hostname of local host
                           #I                Current window index

                           ##                A literal ‘#’

                     The #(command) form executes ‘command’ as a shell command
                     and inserts the first line of its output.  Note that
                     shell commands are only executed once at the interval
                     specified by the ssttaattuuss--iinntteerrvvaall option: if the status
                     line is redrawn in the meantime, the previous result is
                     used.

                     #[attributes] allows a comma-separated list of attributes
                     to be specified, these may be ‘fg=colour’ to set the
                     foreground colour, ‘bg=colour’ to set the background
                     colour, the name of one of the attributes (listed under
                     the mmeessssaaggee--aattttrr option) to turn an attribute on, or an
                     attribute prefixed with ‘no’ to turn one off, for example
                     nnoobbrriigghhtt.  Examples are:

                           #(sysctl vm.loadavg)
                           #[fg=yellow,bold]#(apm -l)%%#[default] [#S]

                     Where appropriate, special character sequences may be
                     prefixed with a number to specify the maximum length, for
                     example ‘#24T’.

                     By default, UTF-8 in _s_t_r_i_n_g is not interpreted, to enable
                     UTF-8, use the ssttaattuuss--uuttff88 option.

                     acter pairs are replaced, and UTF-8 is dependent on the

                     this is important for wide characters.  This option
                     defaults to off.

             tteerrmmiinnaall--oovveerrrriiddeess _s_t_r_i_n_g
                     Contains a list of entries which override terminal
                     descriptions read using terminfo(5).  _s_t_r_i_n_g is a comma-
                     separated list of items each a colon-separated string
                     made up of a terminal type pattern (matched using
                     fnmatch(3)) and a set of _n_a_m_e_=_v_a_l_u_e entries.

                     For example, to set the ‘clear’ terminfo(5) entry to
                     ‘\e[H\e[2J’ for all terminal types and the ‘dch1’ entry
                     to ‘\e[P’ for the ‘rxvt’ terminal type, the option could
                     be set to the string:

                           "*:clear=\e[H\e[2J,rxvt:dch1=\e[P"

                     The terminal entry value is passed through strunvis(3)
                     before interpretation.  The default value forcibly cor-
                     rects the ‘colors’ entry for terminals which support 88

                     Aggressively resize the chosen window.  This means that
                     ttmmuuxx will resize the window to the size of the smallest
                     session for which it is the current window, rather than
                     the smallest session to which it is attached.  The window
                     may resize when the current window is changed on another
                     sessions; this option is good for full-screen programs
                     which support SIGWINCH and poor for interactive programs
                     such as shells.

             List the window options for _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_w_i_n_d_o_w, or the global window

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     When the server is started, ttmmuuxx copies the environment into the _g_l_o_b_a_l
     _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t; in addition, each session has a _s_e_s_s_i_o_n _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t.  When a
     window is created, the session and global environments are merged with
     the session environment overriding any variable present in both.  This is
     the initial environment passed to the new process.

     The uuppddaattee--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt session option may be used to update the session
     environment from the client when a new session is created or an old reat-
     tached.  ttmmuuxx also initialises the TMUX variable with some internal
     information to allow commands to be executed from inside, and the TERM
     variable with the correct terminal setting of ‘screen’.

     Commands to alter and view the environment are:

     sseett--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt [--ggrruu] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n] _n_a_m_e [_v_a_l_u_e]
                   (alias: sseetteennvv)
             Set or unset an environment variable.  If --gg is used, the change
             is made in the global environment; otherwise, it is applied to
             the session environment for _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n.  The --uu flag unsets a
             variable.  --rr indicates the variable is to be removed from the
             environment before starting a new process.

     sshhooww--eennvviirroonnmmeenntt [--gg] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n]
                   (alias: sshhoowweennvv)
             Display the environment for _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_s_e_s_s_i_o_n or the global environ-
             ment with --gg.  Variables removed from the environment are pre-
             fixed with ‘-’.

SSTTAATTUUSS LLIINNEE
     ttmmuuxx includes an optional status line which is displayed in the bottom
     line of each terminal.  By default, the status line is enabled (it may be
     disabled with the ssttaattuuss session option) and contains, from left-to-
     right: the name of the current session in square brackets; the window
     list; the current window title in double quotes; and the time and date.

     The status line is made of three parts: configurable left and right sec-
     tions (which may contain dynamic content such as the time or output from
     a shell command, see the ssttaattuuss--lleefftt, ssttaattuuss--lleefftt--lleennggtthh, ssttaattuuss--rriigghhtt,
     and ssttaattuuss--rriigghhtt--lleennggtthh options below), and a central window list.  The
     window list shows the index, name and (if any) flag of the windows
     present in the current session in ascending numerical order.  The flag is
     one of the following symbols appended to the window name:

           SSyymmbbooll    MMeeaanniinngg
           *         Denotes the current window.
           -         Marks the last window (previously selected).
           #         Window is monitored and activity has been detected.
           !         A bell has occurred in the window.
           +         Window is monitored for content and it has appeared.

     The # symbol relates to the mmoonniittoorr--aaccttiivviittyy and + to the mmoonniittoorr--ccoonntteenntt
     window options.  The window name is printed in inverted colours if an
     alert (bell, activity or content) is present.

     The colour and attributes of the status line may be configured, the
     entire status line using the ssttaattuuss--aattttrr, ssttaattuuss--ffgg and ssttaattuuss--bbgg session
     options and individual windows using the wwiinnddooww--ssttaattuuss--aattttrr,
     wwiinnddooww--ssttaattuuss--ffgg and wwiinnddooww--ssttaattuuss--bbgg window options.

     The status line is automatically refreshed at interval if it has changed,
     the interval may be controlled with the ssttaattuuss--iinntteerrvvaall session option.

     Commands related to the status line are as follows:

     ccoommmmaanndd--pprroommpptt [--pp _p_r_o_m_p_t_s] [--tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_-_c_l_i_e_n_t] [_t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e]
             Open the command prompt in a client.  This may be used from
             inside ttmmuuxx to execute commands interactively.  If _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e is
             specified, it is used as the command.  If --pp is given, _p_r_o_m_p_t_s is
             a comma-separated list of prompts which are displayed in order;
             otherwise a single prompt is displayed, constructed from _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e
             if it is present, or ‘:’ if not.  Before the command is executed,
             the first occurrence of the string ‘%%’ and all occurrences of
             ‘%1’ are replaced by the response to the first prompt, the second
             ‘%%’ and all ‘%2’ are replaced with the response to the second
             prompt, and so on for further prompts.  Up to nine prompt
             responses may be replaced (‘%1’ to ‘%9’).

             entered interactively.

BBUUFFFFEERRSS
     ttmmuuxx maintains a stack of _p_a_s_t_e _b_u_f_f_e_r_s for each session.  Up to the
     value of the bbuuffffeerr--lliimmiitt option are kept; when a new buffer is added,
     the buffer at the bottom of the stack is removed.  Buffers may be added
     using ccooppyy--mmooddee or the sseett--bbuuffffeerr command, and pasted into a window using
     the ppaassttee--bbuuffffeerr command.

     A configurable history buffer is also maintained for each window.  By
     default, up to 2000 lines are kept; this can be altered with the
     hhiissttoorryy--lliimmiitt option (see the sseett--ooppttiioonn command above).

     The buffer commands are as follows:

                   (alias: ccooppyybb)
             Copy a session paste buffer to another session.  If no sessions
             are specified, the current one is used instead.

                   (alias: ddeelleetteebb)
             Delete the buffer at _b_u_f_f_e_r_-_i_n_d_e_x, or the top buffer if not spec-
             ified.

                   (alias: ppaasstteebb)
             Insert the contents of a paste buffer into the current window.
             With --dd, also delete the paste buffer from the stack.  When out-
             put, any linefeed (LF) characters in the paste buffer are
             replaced with carriage returns (CR).  This translation may be
             disabled with the --rr flag.

             Save the contents of the specified paste buffer to _p_a_t_h.  The --aa
             option appends to rather than overwriting the file.

                   (alias: iiff)
             Execute _c_o_m_m_a_n_d if _s_h_e_l_l_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d returns success.

     lloocckk--sseerrvveerr
                   (alias: lloocckk)
             Lock each client individually by running the command specified by
             the lloocckk--ccoommmmaanndd option.

     rruunn--sshheellll _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
                   (alias: rruunn)
             Execute _c_o_m_m_a_n_d in the background without creating a window.
             After the command finishes, any output to stdout is displayed in
             output mode.  If _c_o_m_m_a_n_d doesn’t return success, the exit status
             is also displayed.

     sseerrvveerr--iinnffoo
                   (alias: iinnffoo)
             Show server information and terminal details.

     /etc/tmux.conf     System-wide configuration file.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     To create a new ttmmuuxx session running vi(1):

           $ tmux new-session vi

     Most commands have a shorter form, known as an alias.  For new-session,
     this is nneeww:

           $ tmux new vi

     Alternatively, the shortest unambiguous form of a command is accepted.
     If there are several options, they are listed:

           $ tmux n
           ambiguous command: n, could be: new-session, new-window, next-window

     Within an active session, a new window may be created by typing ‘C-b c’
     (Ctrl followed by the ‘b’ key followed by the ‘c’ key).

     Windows may be navigated with: ‘C-b 0’ (to select window 0), ‘C-b 1’ (to
     select window 1), and so on; ‘C-b n’ to select the next window; and ‘C-b
     p’ to select the previous window.

     A session may be detached using ‘C-b d’ (or by an external event such as
     ssh(1) disconnection) and reattached with:

           $ tmux attach-session

     Typing ‘C-b ?’ lists the current key bindings in the current window; up
     and down may be used to navigate the list or ‘q’ to exit from it.

     Commands to be run when the ttmmuuxx server is started may be placed in the
     _~_/_._t_m_u_x_._c_o_n_f configuration file.  Common examples include:

     Changing the default prefix key:

           set-option -g prefix C-a
           unbind-key C-b
           bind-key C-a send-prefix

     Turning the status line off, or changing its colour:

           set-option -g status off
           set-option -g status-bg blue

     Setting other options, such as the default command, or locking after 30
     minutes of inactivity:

           set-option -g default-command "exec /bin/ksh"
           set-option -g lock-after-time 1800

     Creating new key bindings:

           bind-key b set-option status
           bind-key / command-prompt "split-window ’exec man %%’"
           bind-key S command-prompt "new-window -n %1 ’ssh %1’"
